Types of Rings

Ring Material - Rings can be found in 4 different types of material bronze, silver, gold, platinum. The different materials are able to be enchanted by different spells. You can find bronze, silver, gold, and platinum inside caves and mines. Using a pickaxe on material you find will allow you to put a random number between 1 - 4 of it in your inventory. That material can later be made into a ring.

Ring Durability - Depending on the type of material a ring is made of and the amount of wear accrued when casting a given spell, rings only last x amount of spells cast. 
For example, say we have a bronze ring and we want to enchant it with the spell fireball. Let’s then say that our bronze ring has 30 strength and everytime we use Fireball we accrue 1 wear. Our bronze rings strength would be subtracted by 1 because of the wear that occurred and our ring would then have 29 strength. Once the strength reaches 0 the ring is destroyed.  

Bronze - The most common material found in caves and mines. Bronze is also the weakest material in terms of power level as it can absorb as much magic as any other material. Only weaker levelled spells are capable of being enchanted onto bronze rings because of this. Bronze rings are more durable than both silver and gold for the same reason that they’re weaker, they absorb less magic.

-both silver and gold are used as currency inside the game-

Silver - The second most common material found in caves and mines or awarded as payment for quest. Silver is also the weakest material in terms of power level as it can absorb magic than bronze but not as much as any other material. In comparison to bronze, silver rings can cast more powerful spells but aren’t as durable because they absorb more magic and thus accrue more wear.

Gold - Rare material that can be found in caves or awarded as payment for quests. Gold can absorb a lot of magic and is capable of casting much stronger spells than bronze or silver. Gold rings are not as durable because they absorb more magic and thus accrue more wear.

Platinum - Incredibly rare material that can be found in caves and awarded as payment in some quests. Platinum absorbs the most amount of magic of any materials and thus produces the most powerful versions of spells. Unlike all other materials platinum rings accrue no wear from casting spells and as a result can never be destroyed.
