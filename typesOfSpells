Types of Spells

 Spells are powers that are available in the game such as launching a fireball or creating a mud wall. A spell may be enchanted on to a ring, giving that ring the ability to cast the enchanted spell. 

Shrines are located throughout the region usually at the end of a dungeon. When at a shrine you may enchant a non-enchanted ring with whatever spell is available at the given shrine.

Utility - these spells may not necessarily help you in moments of combat but could help you progress through the storyline or give you other advantages. Alchemy would be a good example, the ability to turn bronze to silver or to turn silver into gold.

Physical - spells that enhance your strength, speed, or jump.

Summoning - a spell that gives the player the ability to bring an object like a greatsword or warhammer into play or a creature like a minotaur or bear to fight alongside you.

Fire/ Lightning - combat spells like launching a fireball or blasting enemies with a steady stream of fire.

Ground/ Plant - balanced spells that focus on rock or ground type abilities. Creating mud walls, creating an elevated platform around yourself, or hurdling a rock at an enemy.

Healing/ Light - the ability to heal yourself or heal anything or anyone fighting alongside the player.

Water/ Ice - the ability to use water to your advantage. In combat the player may be able to cast a tidal wave or flood the battlefield temporarily pushing back all enemies.
